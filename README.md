#Prism

It is with an extremely heavy heart that I must announce that updates to Prism have been suspended indefinitely. This also means that I will be unable accept any pull requests until further notice.

The reason for this suspension is an infringement of my intellectual property and I have been advised to suspend updates in an attempt to minimise any further infringements whilst I pursue the matter through legal channels. I would dearly like to share details of those responsible, but have been advised that this may prejudice any legal process.

It is such a shame that I have been forced in to this position as there are some really exciting features that were going to be added. But I now cannot see when, or even if, these will ever be released.

Some trolls are stupid enough to destroy the bridge they choose to live under.

Au revoir, Prism.
